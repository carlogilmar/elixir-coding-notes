# PR Guidelines

Include

- 📍 Business descripcion and diagrams
- 📍 Especify what feedback are you waiting
- 📍 Functions + Tests + Dialyzer + Credo
- 📍 Code readability feedback will come from your teammates

`Documentation`
- Set a proper description in the `@moduledoc`.
- Put the complete typespec for schemas.

`Cosmetic and readability`
- Private functions doesn't need `@spec`.
- Use global values and default arguments if you need to put an specific value `@default_algorithm :sha256`

`Ecto`
- Validate errors in changesets.

`Git`
- Squash your commits before merge.

## Code guidelines

`Function naming`
- 📍 Organize funcions in order by alphabet.
- 📍 Add `@doc` detached an important piece of logic.
- 📍 For functions to raise errors put ! in the function name.
- 📍 Instead of use `maybe` use `ensure`.

`Logic considerations`
- 📍 Repo operations should use with statement.
- 📍 Instead of case, use pattern matching.
- 📍 Resolve names in specs.
- 📍 Always give a off-ramp to handle error values in functions.

`Unit tests`
- 📍 Use present tense in test descriptions.
- 📍 Unit test: Arrange, act and assert.
- 📍 Don't assert before act in unit tests.
